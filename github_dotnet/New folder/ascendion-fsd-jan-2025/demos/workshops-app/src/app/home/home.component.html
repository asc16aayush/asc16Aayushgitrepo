  The app serves details of (fictitious) technical workshops happening in
  various cities. Every workshop has a broad topic (eg. JavaScript), and a
  workshop has many sessions (each session covers a sub-topic, eg. Closures in
  JavaScript).
</p>
<p>
  You can view a list of workshops, details of every workshop, add a workshop,
  view the list of sessions in a workshop, and also add a new session for a
  workshop.
