what is pom ??
In Java, a POM (Project Object Model) refers to a configuration file used by Maven, a popular build automation tool. The pom.xml file contains information about the project, its dependencies, build configurations, plugins, and other essential details needed for project management.

what is maven ???
Maven is a popular open-source build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the build process, dependency management, and project configuration, allowing developers to focus on coding rather than worrying about the details of building, testing, and packaging their applications.

Key Features of Maven:
Build Automation: Maven automates the build process, such as compiling code, packaging it into JAR/WAR files, running tests, generating documentation, and more. This ensures that the build process is consistent and reproducible.

Dependency Management: One of Mavenâ€™s standout features is its ability to manage project dependencies. When your project relies on external libraries (e.g., Spring, Hibernate, JUnit), Maven automatically downloads them from a central repository like Maven Central or any other repository you specify. It handles versioning, transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies), and ensures your project has all the libraries it needs to run.

what is build automation ??
Build Automation refers to the process of automating the tasks involved in building a software application. In the context of software development, "building" generally means the process of compiling source code, packaging it into executable files (like JAR or WAR files), running tests, generating documentation, and deploying the software.

The goal of build automation is to simplify and streamline the development process, reduce human error, and make the build process reproducible and consistent across different environments (such as development, testing, and production).

Key Elements of Build Automation:
Compilation:

Source Code Compilation: In languages like Java, C++, and others, source code must be compiled into machine-readable code (e.g., bytecode, binary) before execution. Build automation tools automate this compilation process, ensuring that all the necessary files are compiled correctly.
